The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a type error in the file "session.ts" at line 24, causing the build to fail during the compilation process.

**Solution:**
1. Navigate to the file [lib/session.ts](https://github.com/Lekhan2009/ai-studio/blob/main/lib/session.ts) in the repo.
2. Inspect line 24 at the specified column (13) to identify the type error.
3. Fix the type error in the "session.ts" file to resolve the compilation failure.
