The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a syntax error in the file `lib/session.ts` at line 775.

**Solution:**
In the file `lib/session.ts` at [line 775](https://github.com/Lekhan2009/ai-studio/blob/main/lib/session.ts#L775), there seems to be a missing semicolon, '}', or end of file indicated by the error message "Expected ';', '}' or <eof>". Please check the syntax around this line and ensure that it is correct. Fixing this syntax error should allow the build to succeed.

Additionally, as a good practice, always ensure that the necessary dependencies are correctly imported in the file and check for any other syntax issues that might be present in the file.

Make the necessary corrections, push the changes to the repository, and trigger a new build to verify if the issue has been resolved.
