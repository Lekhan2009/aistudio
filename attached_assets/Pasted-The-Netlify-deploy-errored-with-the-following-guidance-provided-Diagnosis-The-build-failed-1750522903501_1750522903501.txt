The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failed due to a type error in the file "app/page.tsx" at line 80-82. The error is: `Property 'id' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & Props'`.

### Solution
To resolve this issue:
1. Verify that the `id` property is properly defined in the `Props` type.
2. If the `id` property is correctly defined, ensure it is accessed properly within the component.
3. If the `project` object might be `undefined`, use optional chaining (`project?.id`) to access its properties safely.

Make sure to address the type error in the "app/page.tsx" file to fix the build failure.
